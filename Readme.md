 # Escapely 
 
 Escapely is an AI-powered web app that helps college students discover hangout spots based on their mood, vibe, budget, and interests.  
Whether you're craving sushi on a budget, planning a chill night with friends, or looking for something spontaneous like an escape room — Vibsy's got you.  
Just tell Vibsy how you’re feeling, and it’ll suggest curated places nearby: cafes, parks, fun zones, restaurants, and more.  
It’s like having a spontaneous, fun-loving friend who knows the city and your taste.  
Perfect for weekends, study breaks, date nights, or “now what?” moments.
